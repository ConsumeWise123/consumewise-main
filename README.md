ConsumeWise is an AI-powered smart label reader that simplifies food labels and helps you understand what you are really consuming. 

It takes the information present on the packaging. And churns out insights and analysis. How much sugar is there in it really? Is it really sugar free? How processed is the food? How much of the recommended protein do you get from having it? Is it a truly healthy snack or does it have any hidden concerns? Think of a Whatsapp bot or a Google plug-in thatâ€™s guiding your every purchase.
